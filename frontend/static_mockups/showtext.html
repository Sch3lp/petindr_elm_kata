                            Watch out, boys, because Princess is here and she’s got baby fever like you wouldn’t believe. Princess is all set up to be
                            in a family way; she’s got her very own nest, it’s feathered, and she sits on it 23 and half
                            hours a day. Golf balls, rocks, other chickens – if she can sit on it and it sort of fits under
                            her, then it’s her baby. Princess is a natural leader when it comes to socializing in the flock,
                            and you can always count on her to call the other girls over to a tasty treat. Are you also longing
                            to hear the pitter patter of little talons in the coop? Do you also looooove tomatoes? Then swipe
                            right on Princess, roosters and hentlemen. Serious inquiries only! Princess has got no time for
                            head games, no siree.
