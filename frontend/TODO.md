# Routing
Let's experiment:

[x] Make sure our Chat page can parse a given pet id, using UrlParser and Navigation.
[x] With the parsed pet id, fetch the pet info and use that to initialize our Model with.
    [x] Modify our rest api to actually return pet info instead of just a boolean.
    [x] Modify the Chat application.
[ ] Improve coupling between Page and its Model/View/Msg records
[ ] Actually make a 404 page
[ ] Deal with Maybe types properly
[ ] Make PetId explicit (instead of an Int)
[ ] Actually try to move to Richard Feldman's architecture
