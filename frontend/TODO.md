# Routing
Let's experiment:

[x] Make sure our Chat page can parse a given pet id, using UrlParser and Navigation.
[ ] With the parsed pet id, fetch the pet info and use that to initialize our Model with.
    [x] Modify our rest api to actually return pet info instead of just a boolean.
    [ ] Modify the Chat application.
